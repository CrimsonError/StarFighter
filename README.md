StarFighter Game

Starfighter Game Demo (Optional: Add a GIF or screenshot of the game in action)
🚀 Description

A Java-based 2D space shooter game where you control a Starfighter to defend your space from enemy ships. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces, along with ArrayLists, matrices, loops, and conditionals.
✨ Features

    Player-controlled Starfighter – Move and shoot using keyboard inputs.

    Enemy ships – Randomly generated enemies with varying behaviors.

    Collision detection – Bullets, player, and enemies interact dynamically.

    Score system – Earn points for destroying enemies.

    OOP Design – Uses:

        Inheritance (e.g., Ship → PlayerShip / EnemyShip)

        Abstract classes (e.g., AbstractShip)

        Interfaces (e.g., Shootable, Movable)
